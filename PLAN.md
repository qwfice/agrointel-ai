# Plan Log

A running log of every plan proposed for this project, newest first. Each entry is written **before** any code changes for that step, so you can review what's about to happen without digging through chat history. Entries get a status update once the work actually lands.

---

## Goal 7 — Carry over the honesty/limitations stance

**Status:** pending approval

**Brief:** review the whole app/repo against the research plan's own stance ("decision support, not guaranteed outcomes") and confirm every static assumption and data gap already called out in code/GOALS.md is also visible to someone just using the app, not just reading source.

---

## Goal 6 — Adjustable farmer priorities

**Status:** done

**Brief:** add sidebar sliders to `app.py` for the six scoring weights, feeding the existing `src/scoring/model.py` formula so dragging a slider live-recomputes real scores. Verified in Chrome.

---

## Goal 5 — Minimal interface

**Status:** done

**Brief:** build a Streamlit app (`app.py`) showing real indicators, a strategy-ranking chart, and the full per-strategy comparison, reusing existing code with no duplicated logic. Verified rendering in the browser.

---

## Goal 4 — Strategy comparisons with explanations

**Status:** done

**Brief:** template-based (not LLM) generator (`src/explanations/narrative.py`) producing evidence/benefits/information-gaps/risks per strategy, with evidence citing actual computed numbers. Output written to `outputs/kern_county_comparison.md`.

---

## Goal 3 — Weighted scoring model

**Status:** done

**Brief:** implement Section 7's weighted formula (`src/scoring/`), mixing real computed indicators (climate resilience, erosion reduction) with documented baseline agronomic assumptions (soil health, water use, pest/disease, economic) where real data isn't integrated yet. Run for Kern County.

---

## Goal 2 — Real environmental indicators

**Status:** done

**Brief:** compute temperature/rainfall anomalies vs. 5-year POWER climatology, dry-spell length, extreme rainfall frequency, and a soil-moisture relative-wetness measure (`src/indicators/environmental.py`). Verified against real Kern County June 2023 numbers.

---

## Goal 1 — Real NASA data integrations

**Status:** done

**Brief:** build NASA POWER, SMAP, and GPM clients (`src/data/`) and prove each against real Kern County, CA coordinates.

---

## How this works

- Before implementing anything, a new entry goes at the top of this log with a brief description and `Status: pending approval`.
- Once you approve it in chat, work begins.
- Once it's actually built, verified, and pushed, the entry's status updates to `Status: done`.
- This file is committed alongside the code it describes.
